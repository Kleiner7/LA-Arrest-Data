### Tools

- Excel - Data cleaning, data analysis, creating reports


### Data Cleaning/Preperation

In the initial data preperation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting


### Exploratory Data Analysis

Explored the arrest data to answer key questions, such as:

- What crimes are being commited the most/least?
- What demographic is committing the most crime?
- Which areas have higher crime rates?


### Insights/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Overall, aggravated assault is the most frequent crime committed, followed by miscellaneous other violations, other assaults, and driving under influence.
- When filtering by gender, we see that women were arrested for prostitution at a much higher rate than men. And men were arrested for Weapon (carry/poss) at a much higher rate than women.
- Most crimes are committed within the age ranges 20-29 and 20-39, with the most arrests within these ranges being felonies and misdemeanors.
- The most crimes were committed in the areas of Rampart, Central, and 77th Street. The fewest crimes were committed in the areas of Wilshire, Harbor, and West Valley.
